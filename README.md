# weather-dashboard
## Languages used 
- HTML 
- Javascript 

## Purpose 
The purpose of this was so that a user can look up the weather in any city and also go back to previous cities looked up. It will show the weather of the day and also a 5 day forcast

## Improvements 
I literally cried everytime doing this- there could probably be a lot done but I know some weather icon colors are missing, probably could've used CSS to snazz it up.
